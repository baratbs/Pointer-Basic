Pointers-Pointees-Dereference

*A Pointer stores a reference to something.


*The pointer points to, is called pointee.


*The term referance is pretty much same as pointer.


*Allocating a pointer and allocating a pointee for it to point to are two seperate steps.


*The dereferance on a pointer only works if the pointer has a pointee.


*The most common error in pointer code is forgetting to set up the pointee.
